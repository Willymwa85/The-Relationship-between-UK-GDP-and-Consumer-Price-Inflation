# The-Relationship-between-UK-GDP-and-Consumer-Price-Inflation
Introduction

The essay examines the relationship between UK GDP growth and consumer price inflation from 2003 to 2023 using quarterly data from the UK Office for National Statistics.
The objectives are to analyze the data distributions, test for correlation, develop a regression model, and visualize time series trends.

Methodology

Descriptive statistics like mean, median, standard deviation were calculated for both datasets.
Correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the statistical relationship between the variables.
Linear regression analysis was performed to model inflation based on GDP growth.
Time series charts visualized the data patterns over the period studied.

Analysis and Results

GDP growth was highly volatile with a mean of 0.37% while inflation averaged 2.44%.
A weak negative correlation of -0.026 was found between GDP growth and inflation.
The regression model showed a minor 0.0143% decrease in inflation for a 1% rise in GDP growth.
Time series charts highlighted the greater variability in GDP versus the more stable inflation.

Conclusion

Despite theory, a near-zero correlation between GDP growth and inflation was found based on the data.
GDP growth alone seems insufficient to explain inflationary trends. More macroeconomic factors likely impact consumer prices.
For inflation forecasting, a more comprehensive approach beyond GDP estimates may be needed.
